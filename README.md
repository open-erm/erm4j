EMR4J is an initiative that must help developers to instantly build multi-purpose entity relation (ER) models of their DB-aware applications.

Created models can be used for 
* Documenting your project's data model, building visual diagrams
* Help writing template code with a help of
  * DDL code generation
  * Standard routine operations (check, find etc.) that work based on created metadata

Models can be create straight from Java code marked with JPA or special ERM4J annotations.
