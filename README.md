# erm4j

## Main goals

EMR4J is an initiative that must help developers to instantly build multi-purpose entity relation (ER) models of their DB-aware applications.

Created models can be used for 
* Documenting your project's data model, storing domain-oriented system and logical view of your data entities
* Better understanding your data model with a help of visual diagrams avalilable on the web
* Help writing template code with a help of
  * DDL code generation
  * Standard routine operations (check, find etc.) that work based on created metadata

## How to build a model
Models can be created by one of the following ways 
* Describing everything in a JSON file
* Creating model with a help of API
* **Straight from Java code marked with JPA or special ERM4J annotations**

## Who can use ERM4J
Every project that uses Java-based ORM (Object-Relation-Mapping) technology can use ERM4J and quickly obtain all the great advantages of having "always-correct", "single-source-of-truth" data model in your project.

If you use any JPA implementations such as 
* Hibernate
* EclipseLink
* etc.

and have your JPA - Entity code annotated with standard @Entity annotations than you are just 5 minutes away from getting your first version of model automatically.
